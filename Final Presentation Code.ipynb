    "##Project Introduction\n",
    "- Predicting whether or not airline customers were satisfied with their flight based off of surveys given to a set of passengers.\n",
    "- This data would be helpful to airlines attempting to identify what would make the most satisfied customer and most enjoyable flight.\n",
    "- Business decisions could be made on findings to improve certain aspects of flying experience to get more returning customers and therefore increase sales.\n",
